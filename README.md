# client-search

## This is an example of sending a form request to the server.

### If you want to work with the project locally:

1. Clone the project `git clone <repository address>`
2. Navigate to the client folder and set the dependencies `npm install`
3. Navigate to the server folder and install the dependencies `npm install`
4. Start the server from the server folder `npm start`
5. Start the client from the client folder `npm start`

Enter in the search box the e-mail address you want to find in the database, for example - jim@gmail.com.
You can also add a phone number, for example - 22-11-22
Click the `Request` button.
Wait for the server to respond.
The fields remain editable while the query is running. You can enter new data and press Enter.
The previous query is canceled and the search resumes with the new data.
